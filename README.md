### 6.0001-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-in-Python
**Solution of Problem Sets of MIT 6.0001**
I have completed this course and I found it quite usefull as a beginners.
The solutions of the Problem Sets would be usefull for people who learn python on their own(which is basically everyone).
Enjoy!!!
